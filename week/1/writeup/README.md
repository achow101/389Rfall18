### Part 2 (75 pts)

If I were to have found many serious security issues in the ECU firmware, the first thing I would do is to report the issues to my boss.
As a security auditor, it is my job to report what I find and ensure that these critical issues are fixed, or at least addressed in some way.
I would inform him of these vulnerabilities and ask to be informed of what is being done.
If I don't receive a response indicating that the issue is serious and something is being done about it, I would then escalate farther up the company hierarchy.
These reports would of course contain a time frame I want to hear a response.
If after some time (e.g. 2 months) and I still have not received a response indicating that the issues are being addressed, I would then go to a consumer watchdog so that they may be able to do something to get the company to address the issues.
If still no serious attempt to address the issues are made after going to the watchdog, I would then ultimately go to the public.

The public disclosure would not include any exploit code or describe the issues enough that they could be exploited.
The goal of public disclosure is only to get public attention and pressure on the company, not to publish a working exploit that people can use.
I would and should go as far as public disclosure if the company is unwilling to fix the issues as these could result in serious injury or death.
If I did nothing, I would be morally responsible for any harm that comes as a result of these vulnerabilities as I could have done something to prevent someone's death or injury but did not.
